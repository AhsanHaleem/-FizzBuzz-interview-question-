# FizzBuzz
It is a very simple and classic programming interview question, used in software developer job interviews, to determine whether the job candidate can actually write code. <br />
<br />
It was invented by Imran Ghory, and popularized by Jeff Atwood. <br />
<br />
Though this challenge will appear very simplistic to those with some coding experience, it is designed to weed out 99.5% programming job candidates who cannot creatively use their coding knowledge to solve simple problems. <br />
<br />
Write a fizzbuzz.cpp program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100. <br />
But for multiples of 3, print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of 5, print Buzz. <br />
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print, FizzBuzz. <br />
